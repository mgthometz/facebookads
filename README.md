## Facebook Advertising KPI Analysis <br>
In this notebook, I explore a real data set from an anonymous organization's Facebook advertising campaign.  I begin the notebook with some exploratory data analysis and then use the data to build some popular advertising key performance indicators.  I then investigate outliers and examine differences in advertising effectiveness among target audiences.  I conclude the analysis by clustering advertisements based on similar key performance indicators.
